Grove - Sunlight Sensor is a multi-channel digital light sensor, which has the ability to detect UV-light, visible light and infrared light.

This device is based on SI1145, a new sensor from SiLabs. The Si1145 is a low-power, reflectance-based, infrared proximity, UV index and ambient light sensor with I2C digital interface and programmable-event interrupt output. This device offers excellent performance under a wide dynamic range and a variety of light sources including direct sunlight.
